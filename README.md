Processing 3 sketches for interactive exhibits

Processing Playground is an ongoing collection of Processing sketches that
focus on readability and interactive connections to GPIO-enabled hardware.

Sketches in this repository are intended for younger audiences in an educational
contexts. The source code should be fully commented for clarity and all GPIO 
handlers should be robust enough to accept digital inputs from a variety of sensors.

- Sandpiles -
A mathematical algrorithm that can be modified to create very complex geometry with very minor changes to the input parameters.

- Math Toys -
Visualizations for mathematical concepts.

-Color Typewriter -
Interface to map inputs to colors.
